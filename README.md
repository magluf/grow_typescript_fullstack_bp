**Wich mechanism do you know to provide security on each data transaction**
```
The most broadly used on web is the use of JWT, which is a cryptographed mean of authenticating the communication between two parties, based on a JSON payload that will include a token that can be decrypted server side to ensure authentication and/or other abstractions of permission to have access to certain server resources.


```
**Can you name some api documentation tool or any other method you have used?**
```
I've worked with Postman and OpenAPI (Swagger).

## Background


### IDE Personalization
**Describe wich resourses you use in order to improve your coding performance**
```
I'm a Visual Studio Code user and I have a bunch of extensions, I'll try to list the main ones that affect my production the most:

* ESLint/Prettier: Keeping opinionated views on code formatting and code best practices;
* Settings Synb: Easily keeping the development environment consistent on multiple machines;
* Remote development exts: Making it possible to use a local IDE to develop on another system through SSH;
* Todo tree: Easily visualize TODO sections of code, for better tracking of ongoing tasks;
* Gitlens: A must have, all around helper for git related things in Visual Studio;
* Image preview: Easily get visual representation of assets in code;
* Import cost: Helps keep track of bundle sizes;
* Tabnine: AI-based code predictions/suggestions;
* Various snippets exts: A bunch of great curated snippets extensions, with a bunch of inclusions of my own to get repetitive boiler plate code out of the way quickly.
```

### Good practices
**Are you familiar with SOLID principles? Do you use any of them?**
```
It's a very abstract concept, but most of its concepts are broadly reiterated, like the single responsability for entities. SOLID itself, in my opinion, is mostly adopted in its full essence in Java projects, which haven't been where I've spent most of my developer hours.
```
**Are you used to include any design pattern in you code? Wich one ?** 
```
```
### Testing
**Have you ever wrote unit or integration tests for your frontend**
```
Yes, tests have been a major focus on most of the projects I've worked on.
```
**Have you used some testing tools for your api?**
```
Postman
```


### Repositories
**Have you pariticipated on a public repository?**
```

```
**Have you ever been in charge of code reviewing?**
```
Yes, code review has been a common practice in the projects I've worked on.
```

### Modules / Libraries
**Do you know how to write a library / module**
```
Yes, I've created and managed NPM libraries, both public and private.
```
**Have you ever published some library , module or piece of code?**
```
Yes.
```

### Cloud expierence
**Are you familiar with cloud platforms**
```
AWS and Heroku.
```
